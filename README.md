# Keras RetinaNet
Keras implementation of RetinaNet object detection as described in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002) by Tsung-Yi Lin, Priya Goyal, Ross Girshick, Kaiming He and Piotr Doll√°r.

## Installation

1) Clone this repository.
2) In the repository, execute `python setup.py install --user`. Note that due to inconsistencies with how `tensorflow` should be installed, this package does not define a dependency on `tensorflow` as it will try to install that (which at least on Arch linux results in an incorrect installation). Please make sure `tensorflow` is installed as per your systems requirements. Also, make sure Keras 2.0.9 is installed.
3) As of writing, this repository requires the master branch of `keras-resnet` (run `pip install --user --upgrade git+https://github.com/broadinstitute/keras-resnet`).
4) Optionally, install `pycocotools` if you want to train / test on the MS COCO dataset. Clone the [`cocoapi` repository](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi) and inside the `PythonAPI` folder, execute `python setup.py install --user`.

## Training
An example on how to train `keras-retinanet` can be found [here](https://github.com/delftrobotics/keras-retinanet/blob/master/examples/train_csv.py).

### Usage
For training on [Pascal VOC](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/), run:
```
python examples/train_pascal.py <path to VOCdevkit/VOC2007>
```

For training on [MS COCO](http://cocodataset.org/#home), run:
```
python examples/train_coco.py <path to MS COCO>
```

For training on a custom dataset, a CSV file can be used as a way to pass the data. To train using your CSV, run:
```
python examples/train_csv.py <path to csv file containing annotations> <path to csv file containing classes>
```

The expected format of each line of the annotations CSV is:
```
filepath,x1,y1,x2,y2,class_name
```

For example:
```
/data/imgs/img_001.jpg,837,346,981,456,cow
/data/imgs/img_002.jpg,215,312,279,391,cat
```
Note that indexing for pixel values starts at 0. The expected format of each line of the classes CSV is:
```
class_name,id
```

For example:
```
cow,0
cat,1
```

In general, the steps to train on your own datasets are:
1) Create a model by calling for instance `keras_retinanet.models.ResNet50RetinaNet` and compile it. Empirically, the following compile arguments have been found to work well:
```
model.compile(
    loss={
        'regression'    : keras_retinanet.losses.regression_loss,
        'classification': keras_retinanet.losses.focal_loss()
    },
    optimizer=keras.optimizers.adam(lr=1e-5, clipnorm=0.001)
)
```
2) Create generators for training and testing data (an example is show in [`keras_retinanet.preprocessing.PascalVocGenerator`](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet/blob/master/keras_retinanet/preprocessing/pascal_voc.py)).
3) Use `model.fit_generator` to start training.

## Testing
An example of testing the network can be seen in [this Notebook](https://github.com/delftrobotics/keras-retinanet/blob/master/examples/ResNet50RetinaNet%20-%20COCO%202017.ipynb). In general, output can be retrieved from the network as follows:
```
_, _, detections = model.predict_on_batch(inputs)
```

Where `detections` are the resulting detections, shaped `(None, None, 4 + num_classes)` (for `(x1, y1, x2, y2, cls1, cls2, ...)`).

Execution time on NVIDIA Pascal Titan X is roughly 55msec for an image of shape `1000x600x3`.

## Results

### MS COCO
The MS COCO model can be downloaded [here](https://delftrobotics-my.sharepoint.com/personal/h_gaiser_fizyr_com/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?docid=0cc7925c4f1154ddda5c5c3c088b8a147&authkey=AUySn3LkZtD4u7nq3viBMiQ&expiration=2017-12-16T15%3A15%3A32.000Z&e=914be80961224618b67321646495f497). Results using the `cocoapi` are shown below (note: according to the paper, this configuration should achieve a mAP of 0.34).

```
 Average Precision  (AP) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area=   all | maxDets=100 ] = 0.305
 Average Precision  (AP) @[ IoU=0.50      | area=   all | maxDets=100 ] = 0.489
 Average Precision  (AP) @[ IoU=0.75      | area=   all | maxDets=100 ] = 0.321
 Average Precision  (AP) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area= small | maxDets=100 ] = 0.135
 Average Precision  (AP) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area=medium | maxDets=100 ] = 0.332
